Data Structures Assignments
Attached are my answers for an assignment in my data structures class. carbon.c is question one, and question two is the ackerman file which
asks us to create a recursive function to calculate ackermans equation. 
The third question asks us to find a way to get the square root of a number wihout actually square rooting it, both recursively and 
non-recursively. That is why there is two files for it.
